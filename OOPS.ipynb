        "ANS- Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming, and while they often work together, they serve different purposes. Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing complexity by allowing the user to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it. For example, when using a coffee machine, you simply press a button to get coffee without knowing how the machine works internally. In programming, abstraction is typically achieved through abstract classes, interfaces, or simply exposing simplified method interfaces to users.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, encapsulation is the technique of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, usually a class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components. This helps in protecting the internal state of the object and ensures that the data is accessed or modified only in intended ways. It is typically implemented using access modifiers like private, public, and protected. For example, in a class, private variables cannot be accessed directly from outside the class, which protects them from accidental or unauthorized changes. In short, abstraction focuses on hiding the complexity, while encapsulation focuses on hiding the internal data and ensuring controlled access.\n"

A class variable is shared among all instances of a class and is defined outside any methods, directly within the class body. It holds the same value for every object unless explicitly changed at the class level. In contrast, an instance variable is specific to each individual object and is usually defined inside the __init__() method using self. This means each object can have different values for its instance variables, representing its unique state. For example, if you have a Dog class with a class variable species = \"Canine\", all dog objects will share this species value. But if you have instance variables like name and age, each dog object (like dog1 and dog2) can have different names and ages. In summary, class variables are useful for storing shared data across all instances, while instance variables are used to store object-specific data.\n",

Thanks to inheritance, subclasses can override methods defined in the parent class to provide their own specific behavior, and when you invoke those methods on subclass objects through a superclass reference, the appropriate overridden method runs.
